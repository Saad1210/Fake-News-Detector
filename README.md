# Fake News Detector Chrome Extension
**Project Overview**

This project involves the development of a Chrome extension designed to help users identify and avoid fake news. By analyzing the content of news articles in real-time, the extension aims to increase awareness and prevent the spread of misinformation. The extension is built using Flask for the frontend and leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news as either legitimate or fake with a high degree of accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time Fake News Detection: Instantly analyze and classify news articles while browsing.
- User-friendly Interface: A streamlined browser extension interface developed with Flask for easy user interaction.
- High Accuracy: Achieves 92% accuracy in detecting fake news using an SVM model.
- Content Analysis: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and NLTK for data preprocessing to ensure robust text analysis.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Frontend: Flask
- Libraries:
    - NTLK: For natural language processing and text analysis.
    - TF-IDF Vectorizer: For converting text data into meaningful vectors.
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM): For classifying news as fake or legitimate..
